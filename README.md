# Mass Molarity Calculator
A simple mass molarity calculator, built as my first python program. 
Determines Volume, Moles or Molarity of a solution using the molarity equation.
Also includes a mass to mole and mole to mass conversion tool using the molmass library.
Volume can be in mL or L, but make sure that your mass is in grams.
